## Introduction
CVRKD-IQA is the first content-variant reference IQA method via knowledge distillation. The practicability of previous FR-IQAs is affected by the requirement for pixel-level aligned reference images. And NR-IQAs still have the potential to achieve better performance since HQ image information is not fully exploited. Hence, we use non-aligned reference (NAR) images to introduce various prior distributions of high-quality images. Moreover, the comparisons of distribution differences between HQ and LQ images can help our model better assess the image quality. Further, the knowledge distillation transfers more HQ-LQ distribution difference information from the FR-teacher to the NAR-student and stabilizing CVRKD-IQA performance. Since the content-variant and non-aligned reference HQ images are easy to obtain, our model can support more IQA applications with its relative robustness to content variations.

## Prepare data
### Training datasets
Download synthetic [Kaddid-10K](http://database.mmsp-kn.de/kadid-10k-database.html) dataset. And download the training HQ images of [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) as the reference dataset.

### Testing datasets
Download synthetic [LIVE](http://live.ece.utexas.edu/index.php), [CSIQ](https://qualinet.github.io/databases/image/categorical_image_quality_csiq_database/) [TID2013](http://www.ponomarenko.info/tid2013.htm) and authentic [KonIQ-10K](http://database.mmsp-kn.de/koniq-10k-database.html) datasets. And download the testing HQ images of [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) as the reference dataset.

Place those unzipped data in ./dataset file
## Train
### 1.Train the FR-teacher
(1) (optional) Download models for our paper and place it in './model_zoo/'
   The models for FR-teacher can be downloaded from [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1niFBV-ysJeVoaXUPQp-08ovrjS9tPhGW/view?usp=sharing)
   
(2) Quick start (you can change the options in option_train_DistillationIQA_FR.py)
```
Python train_DistillationIQA_FR.py --self_patch_num 10 --patch_size 224
```
### 2.Fix pretrained FR-teacher and train the NAR-student
(1) (optional) Download models for our paper and place it in './model_zoo/'
   The models for FR-teacher and NAR-student can be downloaded from [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/107TI1pa0TDxs3V8tO2KhmhKJmfc9ZOl4/view?usp=sharing)
   
(2) Quick start (you can change the options in option_train_DistillationIQA.py)
```
Python train_DistillationIQA.py --self_patch_num 10 --patch_size 224
```

## Test
(1) Make sure the trained models are placed in './model_zoo/FR_teacher_cross_dataset.pth' and './model_zoo/NAR_student_cross_dataset.pth' 

(2) Quick start (you can change the options in option_train_DistillationIQA.py)
```
Python test_DistillationIQA.py
```
(3) test single image
```
Python test_DistillationIQA_single.py
```

## T-SNE visual visualization of HQ-LQ difference-aware features of NAR-student w/ and w/o KD
After distilled with FR-teacher, the HQ-LQ features in Fig(b) are clusterd. It proves that the HQ-LQ distribution difference prior from the FR-teacher can indeed
help the NAR-student extract quality-sensitive discriminative features for more accurate and consistent performance.
